# PHP File Opening Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP file handling and its solution.  The bug involves failing to properly check the return value of the `fopen()` function, leading to potential errors if the file doesn't exist.

The `bug.php` file shows the incorrect implementation.  `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version.
